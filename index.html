      After 25 years working in Financial Services, building a successful career focussed on Risk and Governance, I came to the conclusion that I needed a move into a field that I found far more interesting for the 
      remainder of my working life. Being a highly analytical and proven problem solver, with a long running curiousity regarding coding, learning core coding skills and exploring areas like web development or full stack 
      development is an exciting prospect. Having started my learning with basic HTML, I decided that the best way to practice would be to create web pages documenting my learning, both as a personal resource to refer to, 
      but also as a knowledge embedding practice. So here it is, my first page developed using basic HTML!</p>

        <section>
        <h2>The core topics I have studied</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Basic HTML structure</li>
            <li>Headings and paragraphs</li>
            <li>Lists</li>
            <li>Embedding external links</li>
            <li>Embedding pictures and videos</li>
            <li>Labelling external media</li>
          </ul>

              <li><a href="https://www.freeCodeCamp.org" Title="freeCodeCamp">FreeCodeCamp</a> has been the primary source of my development at this time, with a number of free courses available to begin a coding journey.</li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/" Title="Github">Github</a> for general information and exploring how others approached their learning.</li>
              <li>There are many courses also on youtube, but the following is next on my playlist:</li>

        <p>This page is just somewhere for me to practice and implement my learning to date. To close, this is a picture of my dog</p>
